# Time-based-Password
Any one that is versed in information security would tell you that passwords are an insecure way of authenticating users. Yet a combination of usernames and passwords are the standard for authorizing users across millions of websites around the world. This is because of one simple reason: itâ€™s easy for the end user. The convenience associated with passwords comes at the cost of security; so websites must build extra security around these passwords to protect them. Our goal in this project was to come up with a protocol that would add an additional layer of security to passwords.
